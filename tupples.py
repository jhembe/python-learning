# tupple is another important structure in python
# tupple are more simmilar to list,unlike list we can not modify them. 
# we define tupples are immutable
# we use square brackets to define list and parenthesis to define tupples

#consider:
tupple_number = (1,5,8,2)
tupple_number.index(1)
print(tupple_number.index(1))

## NOTE: we can only get information about a tupple, we cannot change it..
print(len(tupple_number))

#we can also acces items in the tupples..
#example:
print(tupple_number[0])
