# This is a powerfull feature in pyhton.. for instance:
#if we want to use the inside elements as they are:
#considetr:

tupple_numbers = (5,2,8,3,6,1)
#we can store these numbers in individual variables
x = tupple_numbers[0]
y = tupple_numbers[0]
z = tupple_numbers[0]
m = tupple_numbers[0]
# The above way is way more challenging. So we can now try the unpacking feature of python
# okay the following is how you can do it easilly
#
a,b,c,d,e,f =tupple_numbers
print(a) 
print(f)
