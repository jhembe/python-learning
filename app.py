# .replace("original_string","replacing string")
# lets find first..
# print(course.find("am"))
# print(course.replace("am","is"))
#this replace method, can also work in characters, not only in words

#we can also check the existance of the characters in a variable using "in" operator
#it normally returns a bolean value
# print("is" in course)
#it is case sensitive, hence changing in uper case
# print("Is" in course)
# print(course.title())
# find method returns the index of the character of the stirng variable..
# while the "in" operator, returns the boolean value if either the searched word is present ...
